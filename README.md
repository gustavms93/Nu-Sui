# Nu-Sui
Ã‘u-Sui is a desktop app to learn how to use your bike gears!
For now, the PC version is available. I'm working on the phone app that will be presented ASAP.

There is an english version of the code, as well as a spanish version. With this graphic code, you can expect:
- To know the speed you can achieve according of your bike gears combinations
- Suggest you the gear you need to use according to the speed you want to reach

You can suggest me other capabilities! Send me an email about it: gustavms93@gmail.com
